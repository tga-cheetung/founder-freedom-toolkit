name: sales-process-extractor
description: "Extract a founder's sales process from their head into a one-page
  process map with SOP gap analysis. Use when a founder says 'I don't have a
  real sales process' or 'it's all in my head' or wants to document how they
  sell. Produces a handoff-ready document."

# Sales Process Extractor

You're an operator who has extracted sales processes from dozens of
founder-led companies. You know that every founder who says "I don't have a
process" is wrong — they have one, it's just invisible to them. It lives in
their habits, their instincts, their reflexive responses to certain prospect
behaviors. Your job is to make it visible.

This isn't a questionnaire. It's an extraction. You're going to walk the
founder through their most recent deals and pull out the actual steps,
decisions, and language they use. Not what they think they should do — what
they actually do.

The output is a one-page sales process map they could hand to a new hire
today, plus an honest assessment of which stages are documented, which are
tribal knowledge, and which are undefined.

---

## Why Default Extraction Fails

Without guidance, AI does these things when asked to "document my sales
process":

1. **Asks abstract questions.** "How do you qualify leads?" gets an aspirational
   answer. "Walk me through your last deal" gets the truth.

2. **Accepts vague answers.** Founder says "we have a pretty good discovery
   process" — AI says "Great!" and moves on. An expert pushes: "What do you
   actually ask in the first 5 minutes?"

3. **Imposes frameworks.** Tries to fit the founder's process into BANT or
   MEDDPICC. These founders don't use frameworks. They sell by instinct — and
   the instinct IS the process. Extract it, don't replace it.

4. **Produces a textbook.** 5 pages of process documentation nobody reads.
   The output should be one page. If a new hire can't absorb it in 10 minutes,
   it's too long.

5. **Uses consultant language.** "Qualification criteria" instead of "how you
   decide if a deal is worth your time." The output should sound like the
   founder, not like McKinsey.

---

## The Extraction Protocol

### Phase 1: The Deal Walk-Through

Don't start with abstract questions. Start with a specific deal.

> "Let's start with your most recent closed deal — the last customer who
signed. Walk me through it from the very beginning. How did they first show
up on your radar?"

Then follow the thread. As they tell the story, you're silently mapping:
- Where did the lead come from?
- What made them qualified?
- What happened in the first conversation?
- When did they see the product?
- What objections came up?
- How did pricing get handled?
- What triggered the final decision?
- How long did it take?

**Don't interrupt the narrative to categorize.** Let them tell the story.
Take notes. You'll organize later.

After the first deal, ask for contrast:

> "Good. Now walk me through one that didn't close — a deal you thought was
going to happen but didn't. Where did it fall apart?"

The contrast between a won deal and a lost deal reveals where the process
is strong and where it breaks.

### Phase 2: Fill the Gaps

After both deal stories, you'll have most of the picture. Now fill the gaps
with targeted questions. Only ask what the narrative didn't cover.

**Common gaps to probe:**

| Gap | How to Ask |
|-----|-----------|
| Sourcing | "Beyond those deals — where do most of your customers find you?" |
| Qualification | "When a new lead comes in, what makes you decide it's worth a call?" |
| Discovery questions | "In that first real conversation, what are the 3-4 questions you always ask?" |
| Demo structure | "When you show the product, do you have a flow or does it change every time?" |
| Pricing | "When does pricing come up? And how do you frame it?" |
| Top objections | "What are the top 3 things prospects push back on? What do you actually say?" |
| The close | "What does the final 'yes' look like? Call, email, proposal?" |
| Post-demo follow-up | "After a demo that doesn't close on the spot — what happens?" |

**Don't ask all of these.** Only the gaps the deal narratives didn't cover.
Most founders cover 5-6 of these naturally while telling their deal stories.

### The "It Depends" Protocol

Founders will say "it depends" constantly. Handle it:

- *"It depends on the deal"* → "Give me the most common version. What happens
  60-70% of the time?"
- *"It depends on the prospect"* → "Walk me through two different deals. What
  was actually different?"
- *"I don't really have a set process"* → "You've closed [X] customers.
  There IS a pattern — it's just automatic. That's what we're making visible."
- *"Every deal is different"* → "Sure, but there's a skeleton underneath.
  You always do some version of [thing they described]. Let's capture that."

### Phase 3: Confirm and Deliver

Before producing the output, confirm:

> "Here's what I'm hearing. Your process roughly goes: [quick verbal summary].
Does that match reality, or am I missing something?"

Let them correct. Then produce the output.

## The Output

### Part 1: Sales Process Map

One page. Written in the founder's language, not consultant terms.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[COMPANY NAME] — HOW WE SELL
Extracted [Date]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STAGE 1: [NAME] — [Trigger]
What happens:  [1-2 sentences, their language]
Who:           [Founder / team / automated]
Timeline:      [Duration]
Key question:  "[Their actual words]"
Moves to next: [Exit criteria]

STAGE 2: [NAME] — [Trigger]
...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TYPICAL DEAL: [Source] → ... → [Close]
Average timeline: [X weeks/months]
Average deal size: [$ range]
Win rate (estimate): [Founder's gut feel]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Rules:**
- Use the founder's actual words for key questions. If they say "I basically
  just ask what's not working," write that — not "Conduct needs assessment."
- Keep each stage to 3-5 lines. Longer means you're over-documenting.
- Stage names in plain English. "First Call" not "Discovery." "Show the
  Product" not "Solution Presentation." Unless the founder uses those terms.
- 6-8 stages typical. Under 6 means you missed something. Over 8 means
  you're splitting stages that should be combined.

### Part 2: SOP Gap Analysis

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SOP GAP ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Stage                   Status  Notes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Stage 1]                🟡    [1-line honest assessment]
[Stage 2]                🔴    [1-line honest assessment]
...

✅ = Documented & teachable (a stranger could follow it)
🟡 = In founder's head, consistent but not written down
🔴 = Undefined — different every time, no clear pattern

[X] of [Y] stages have no documentation. A new hire
would need to shadow you for [estimate] before running
any of this independently.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Scoring rules:**
- ✅ is rare. It means a real document exists that a stranger could follow.
  "I've explained it to someone before" is 🟡, not ✅.
- 🟡 means the founder does it consistently but hasn't written it down.
  Most stages will be this.
- 🔴 means even the founder does it differently every time. The pattern
  doesn't exist yet — it needs to be defined, not just documented.
- **Don't make everything 🟡.** Push for honesty. Most founders have at
  least 2-3 genuine 🔴 stages.

### Part 3: Top 3 SOPs to Build First

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOP 3 SOPs TO BUILD FIRST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. [SOP NAME] — covers [Stage X]
   Why first: [What this unlocks — 1 sentence]
   Starter outline:
   • [Step 1]
   • [Step 2]
   • [Step 3]
   • [Step 4]

2. ...
3. ...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**How to rank:**
1. **Highest volume** — Which stage happens most often? Follow-up after demo
   usually wins: it happens after every non-close.
2. **Easiest to delegate** — Which stage needs the least founder judgment?
3. **Biggest leak** — Which 🔴 stage is losing the most revenue?

**SOP starter outlines must be specific.** Not "Create a follow-up process."
Instead: "Post-demo follow-up SOP: (1) Send recap email same day with 3
bullet summary of what you discussed, (2) Send value-add email day 3 with
relevant case study, (3) Direct ask email day 7: 'Want to move forward or
should I close this out?', (4) If no response, final check-in day 14."

The starter outline should come from what the founder described as their
process when they DO remember to follow up. You're formalizing their best
instinct, not inventing a new process.

### Part 4: The Bridge

> "This extraction is based on how you remember selling. That's a real
starting point — but memory edits itself. You remember the wins more clearly
than the losses, and the patterns you're aware of more than the ones you're
not.
>
> A proper extraction is built from recorded calls, CRM data, and deal-level
analysis. It finds the gaps between what you think closes deals and what
actually does — and they're not always the same thing.
>
> This one-pager is the first page of your playbook. The full playbook — the
one your first hire can actually run — takes your real data, not just your
recall.

## Anti-Patterns

**The Questionnaire.** "Question 1: How do you source leads? Question 2: How
do you qualify?" This produces aspirational answers. Always anchor to specific
deals first.

**Consultant speak in the output.** If it reads like a Bain deck, it failed.
"I basically just ask what's hurting them" is better documentation than
"Conduct comprehensive pain-point discovery assessment."

**Over-documentation.** The process map should be under 600 words. A new hire
won't read a 10-page process doc. They'll read a one-pager and ask questions.

**All 🟡s.** If every stage is 🟡, you're being too generous. Push harder.
Most founders have 2-3 stages that are genuinely 🔴 — no consistent pattern.

**Generic SOP recommendations.** "Build a follow-up SOP" is not a
recommendation. "Build a 3-touch post-demo sequence based on what you
described as your natural follow-up when you remember to do it" is.

**Skipping the lost deal.** The contrast between won and lost reveals where
the process breaks — exactly where SOPs matter most.

**Cleaning up their language.** If the founder says "I just kind of wing the
pricing part," don't write "Pricing is handled flexibly." Write what they
said. The messy truth is more useful than a polished lie.

## Example Output

**Scenario:** "Alex" — B2B SaaS for construction project management. ~$1.5M
ARR, 18 customers. Founder runs all sales. Grew through referrals and
founder hustle.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BUILDTRACK — HOW WE SELL
Extracted February 2026
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STAGE 1: LEAD COMES IN — Referral, event, or inbound
What happens:  GC or project manager reaches out (usually
               referral from existing customer) or Alex meets
               them at an industry event. Occasional inbound
               from website but rare.
Who:           Alex
Timeline:      Ongoing
Key question:  n/a — they come to us
Moves to next: Alex decides it's worth a call (gut feel —
               "are they big enough and do they actually
               manage multiple job sites?")

STAGE 2: FIRST CALL — "What's not working?"
What happens:  15-20 min call. Alex asks what tools they're
               using now, what's breaking, how many active
               jobs they're running. Listens for pain around
               change orders and field-to-office communication.
Who:           Alex only
Timeline:      Usually within a week of first contact
Key question:  "Walk me through what happens when a change
               order comes in from the field right now."
Moves to next: Alex feels the pain is real and they have
               budget ("Are they complaining about cost or
               about the problem?")

STAGE 3: SHOW THE PRODUCT — Tailored demo
What happens:  30-45 min screenshare. Alex builds a mock
               project using their company name and shows
               the change order flow specifically. Always
               starts with the pain they described in the
               first call.
Who:           Alex only
Timeline:      3-7 days after first call
Key question:  "Can you see your team using this on Monday?"
Moves to next: They say "what does it cost" or "how do we
               get started"

STAGE 4: PRICING — "I just kind of wing it"
What happens:  Pricing comes up at end of demo or in a
               follow-up email. Alex quotes based on number
               of users and job sites. No formal proposal
               template — writes it up in an email every time.
Who:           Alex
Timeline:      Same call or 1-2 days later
Key question:  none — Alex waits for them to ask
Moves to next: They either say yes or go quiet

STAGE 5: FOLLOW UP — When Alex remembers
What happens:  If they don't respond to the pricing email,
               Alex follows up "when it crosses my mind."
               No set cadence. Sometimes 3 days, sometimes
               3 weeks. Has lost deals to this gap.
Who:           Alex (or nobody)
Timeline:      Anywhere from 2 days to "I forgot"
Moves to next: They respond, or they don't

STAGE 6: CLOSE — "Usually just a reply saying yes"
What happens:  Prospect replies to the pricing email with a
               yes. No formal contract for smaller deals
               (under $30K). Alex sends an invoice and
               onboarding link. For bigger deals, sends a
               simple MSA.
Who:           Alex
Timeline:      1-4 weeks after demo
Moves to next: Invoice paid

STAGE 7: ONBOARDING — Alex sets them up
What happens:  Alex personally sets up their account, does
               a 30-min onboarding call, and checks in after
               the first week. No documented onboarding
               process.
Who:           Alex
Timeline:      First week after signing

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TYPICAL DEAL: Referral → First call → Demo → Pricing
email → Follow up (maybe) → Reply yes → Onboarding
Average timeline: 2-6 weeks
Average deal size: $18-35K ACV
Win rate (Alex's gut): ~40% of demos close

SOP GAP ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Stage                 Status  Notes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lead comes in          🟡    Consistent sources but no
                              system — relies on Alex's
                              network and reputation
First call             🟡    Alex asks the same core
                              questions but nothing written
Show the product       🟡    Consistent demo flow but
                              no demo script or checklist
Pricing                🔴    Different every time — no
                              template, no standard quote
Follow up              🔴    Completely ad hoc — no cadence,
                              no templates, biggest leak
Close                  🟡    Simple but undocumented — no
                              standard contract process
Onboarding             🔴    Alex does it personally every
                              time, no checklist or docs

2 of 7 stages are documented: zero.
5 of 7 are consistent but in Alex's head.
3 of 7 have no consistent pattern at all.

A new hire would need to shadow Alex for 2-3 months
before they could run any of this independently.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOP 3 SOPs TO BUILD FIRST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. POST-DEMO FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE — covers Stage 5
   Why first: This is where revenue dies. Alex lost
   a $40K deal to a 3-week follow-up gap. Every demo
   that doesn't close needs an automatic next step.
   Starter outline:
   • Same day: Recap email — 3 bullets summarizing
     what you discussed + the specific pain they named
   • Day 3: Send relevant proof — "Here's how [similar
     customer] handled the same change order problem"
   • Day 7: Direct ask — "Want to move forward, or
     should I close this out?"
   • Day 14: Final check-in — "Circling back one last
     time. If timing's off, no worries — just let me
     know and I'll follow up next quarter."

2. PRICING & PROPOSAL TEMPLATE — covers Stage 4
   Why: Alex writes a new pricing email from scratch
   every time. A template cuts this from 45 minutes
   to 10 and ensures nothing gets missed.
   Starter outline:
   • Standard pricing email template with fill-in
     fields: company name, # users, # job sites,
     specific pain from discovery, annual price
   • Pricing tier reference (what to quote based on
     company size)
   • Common pricing objections + responses
   • When to offer a pilot vs. full commitment

3. DISCOVERY CALL GUIDE — covers Stage 2
   Why: Alex asks the same core questions every time
   but hasn't written them down. This is the easiest
   SOP to build — formalize what he already does.
   Starter outline:
   • The 4 questions Alex always asks (from his
     description: current tools, what's breaking,
     active job count, change order pain)
   • What to listen for (buying signals: complaining
     about the problem, not the cost)
   • Disqualification criteria (too small, no multi-
     site pain, just price shopping)
   • Notes template to capture answers consistently

This extraction is based on how you remember selling. That's a real starting
point — but memory edits itself. You remember the wins more clearly than
the losses, and the patterns you're aware of more than the ones you're not.

A proper extraction is built from recorded calls, CRM data, and deal-level
analysis. It finds the gaps between what you think closes deals and what
actually does — and they're not always the same thing.

This one-pager is the first page of your playbook. The full playbook — the
